#Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string
#It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
#For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.

#> caesar_cipher("What a string!", 5)
#=> "Bmfy f xywnsl!"
